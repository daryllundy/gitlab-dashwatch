# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves completely removing the authentication system from GitLab DashWatch, converting it from a multi-user authenticated application to a single-user, unauthenticated monitoring dashboard. This change will simplify the application architecture by eliminating user management, authentication flows, and user-specific data persistence, while maintaining all core monitoring functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to use GitLab DashWatch without any authentication requirements, so that I can quickly deploy and access monitoring dashboards without user management overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the application THEN the system SHALL display the main dashboard immediately without any login prompts
2. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL NOT require any authentication credentials or user setup
3. WHEN accessing any page or feature THEN the system SHALL NOT redirect to authentication dialogs or login screens

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all authentication-related code removed from the codebase, so that the application has a cleaner architecture without unused authentication infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN the system SHALL NOT contain any Supabase authentication imports or configurations
2. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN the system SHALL NOT contain any GitHub OAuth integration code
3. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN the system SHALL NOT contain any AuthContext, AuthDialog, or UserMenu components
4. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN the system SHALL NOT contain any authentication-related services or utilities
5. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN the system SHALL NOT contain any authentication-related environment variables or configurations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want my dashboard settings to persist locally, so that my monitoring configurations are maintained between browser sessions without requiring user accounts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user modifies dashboard settings THEN the system SHALL save these settings to browser localStorage
2. WHEN a user returns to the application THEN the system SHALL restore their previous settings from localStorage
3. WHEN localStorage is unavailable THEN the system SHALL use sensible default settings
4. WHEN settings are corrupted or invalid THEN the system SHALL reset to default settings gracefully

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing monitoring features to continue working exactly as before, so that removing authentication doesn't impact the core functionality I depend on.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring GitLab instances THEN the system SHALL continue to display all project and server status information
2. WHEN monitoring website uptime THEN the system SHALL continue to track and display availability metrics
3. WHEN monitoring DNS records THEN the system SHALL continue to check and display DNS resolution status
4. WHEN monitoring server health THEN the system SHALL continue to integrate with Netdata and display system metrics
5. WHEN using the settings page THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of all monitoring parameters

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application build and deployment process to be simplified, so that authentication-related dependencies and configurations are no longer required.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL NOT require Supabase URL or API key environment variables
2. WHEN deploying with Docker THEN the system SHALL NOT require authentication-related environment variables
3. WHEN running in development mode THEN the system SHALL start successfully without any authentication configuration
4. WHEN reviewing package.json THEN the system SHALL NOT contain Supabase client dependencies

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the navigation and UI to be streamlined without authentication elements, so that the interface focuses purely on monitoring functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the navigation bar THEN the system SHALL NOT display login/logout buttons or user menu options
2. WHEN viewing the navigation bar THEN the system SHALL NOT display user profile information or authentication status
3. WHEN viewing any page THEN the system SHALL NOT display authentication-related dialogs or modals
4. WHEN using the application THEN the system SHALL provide a clean, focused monitoring interface without authentication UI elements
