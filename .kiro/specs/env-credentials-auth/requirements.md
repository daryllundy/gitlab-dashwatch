# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the authentication system to support predefined user credentials stored in environment variables. This allows for automated sign-in scenarios, testing environments, and administrative access without requiring manual credential entry. The feature maintains backward compatibility with the existing authentication flow while adding support for environment-based credential management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure default user credentials in environment variables, so that I can automate sign-in processes and provide seamless access for testing and administrative purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environment variables contain user credentials THEN the system SHALL load and validate these credentials at startup
2. WHEN multiple credential sets are defined in environment variables THEN the system SHALL support loading multiple user accounts
3. WHEN credential environment variables are malformed or invalid THEN the system SHALL log appropriate warnings and continue with normal authentication flow
4. WHEN environment credentials are present THEN the system SHALL provide an option to sign in using these predefined accounts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use environment-based credentials for automated testing, so that I can run integration tests without manual authentication steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in development or test mode THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt to sign in using environment credentials if available
2. WHEN environment-based sign-in fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to the standard authentication flow
3. WHEN environment credentials are used for sign-in THEN the system SHALL indicate the authentication source in logs
4. WHEN switching between environment and manual authentication THEN the system SHALL maintain proper session management

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to configure service account credentials via environment variables, so that I can deploy the application with pre-configured access for monitoring and administrative tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying in production THEN the system SHALL support service account credentials from environment variables
2. WHEN service account credentials are used THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate role-based permissions
3. WHEN environment credentials include role information THEN the system SHALL respect user roles and permissions
4. WHEN environment-based authentication is disabled THEN the system SHALL function normally with manual authentication only

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security-conscious administrator, I want environment credential support to be secure and configurable, so that I can control when and how these credentials are used.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environment credentials are enabled THEN the system SHALL provide configuration options to enable/disable this feature
2. WHEN environment credentials are processed THEN the system SHALL never log or expose actual credential values
3. WHEN environment credentials are invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages without revealing sensitive information
4. WHEN environment authentication is disabled via configuration THEN the system SHALL ignore all environment credential variables

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the authentication UI to indicate when environment credentials are available, so that I can choose between manual and automated sign-in options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environment credentials are available THEN the authentication dialog SHALL display an option to use predefined accounts
2. WHEN multiple environment accounts are configured THEN the system SHALL allow selection between different predefined accounts
3. WHEN using environment credentials THEN the UI SHALL clearly indicate the authentication method being used
4. WHEN environment authentication fails THEN the UI SHALL provide clear feedback and fallback options
