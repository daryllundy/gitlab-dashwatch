# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will integrate with the GitLab API to pull repository data from gitlab.com, enabling users to monitor their GitLab projects, issues, merge requests, and repository activity directly within the GitLab DashWatch dashboard. The integration will provide real-time insights into project health, development activity, and team productivity metrics.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to connect my GitLab account to the dashboard, so that I can monitor all my GitLab projects in one centralized location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the GitLab settings section THEN the system SHALL display an option to connect their GitLab account
2. WHEN a user provides their GitLab personal access token THEN the system SHALL validate the token and store it securely
3. WHEN a user's GitLab token is invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and prompt for re-authentication
4. WHEN a user successfully connects their GitLab account THEN the system SHALL display their GitLab username and connection status

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a development team lead, I want to view a list of all my GitLab projects, so that I can select which projects to monitor on my dashboard.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has connected their GitLab account THEN the system SHALL fetch and display all accessible projects
2. WHEN the project list is loading THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator
3. WHEN there are no accessible projects THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message
4. WHEN a user can access more than 20 projects THEN the system SHALL implement pagination or infinite scrolling
5. WHEN a project has visibility settings THEN the system SHALL display the appropriate visibility indicator (public, internal, private)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to see key metrics for each GitLab project, so that I can quickly assess project health and activity levels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying a project THEN the system SHALL show the project name, description, and last activity date
2. WHEN displaying a project THEN the system SHALL show the number of open issues, merge requests, and total commits
3. WHEN displaying a project THEN the system SHALL show the project's star count and fork count
4. WHEN a project has recent activity THEN the system SHALL highlight it with an appropriate status indicator
5. WHEN project data is stale or unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate warning or error state

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to monitor specific GitLab projects on my dashboard, so that I can track their status and recent activity without leaving the monitoring interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects projects to monitor THEN the system SHALL save their selection to their user settings
2. WHEN a user views their dashboard THEN the system SHALL display status cards for all selected GitLab projects
3. WHEN a project has recent commits THEN the system SHALL display the latest commit information
4. WHEN a project has open merge requests THEN the system SHALL display the count and highlight urgent ones
5. WHEN a project has critical issues THEN the system SHALL display appropriate warning indicators

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the GitLab integration to handle API rate limits gracefully, so that the monitoring system remains stable and doesn't get blocked by GitLab.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making GitLab API requests THEN the system SHALL respect GitLab's rate limiting headers
2. WHEN approaching rate limits THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff for retries
3. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL queue requests and retry after the reset time
4. WHEN API requests fail THEN the system SHALL log appropriate error messages for debugging
5. WHEN the GitLab API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display cached data with a staleness indicator

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want my GitLab credentials to be stored securely, so that my access tokens are protected from unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides their GitLab token THEN the system SHALL encrypt it before storage
2. WHEN storing GitLab credentials THEN the system SHALL use Supabase's secure storage mechanisms
3. WHEN a user disconnects their GitLab account THEN the system SHALL completely remove all stored credentials
4. WHEN making API requests THEN the system SHALL never log or expose the access token in plain text
5. WHEN a user is in guest mode THEN GitLab tokens SHALL be stored only in encrypted local storage

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to see real-time updates for GitLab project data, so that I can stay informed about the latest changes and activity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh GitLab data at configurable intervals
2. WHEN new data is available THEN the system SHALL update the display without requiring a page refresh
3. WHEN data is being refreshed THEN the system SHALL show subtle loading indicators
4. WHEN refresh fails THEN the system SHALL display the last successful data with a staleness warning
5. WHEN a user manually triggers a refresh THEN the system SHALL immediately fetch the latest data

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user with multiple GitLab instances, I want to configure custom GitLab endpoints, so that I can monitor both gitlab.com and self-hosted GitLab instances.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring GitLab integration THEN the system SHALL allow users to specify custom GitLab instance URLs
2. WHEN a custom GitLab URL is provided THEN the system SHALL validate the endpoint before saving
3. WHEN connecting to self-hosted GitLab THEN the system SHALL handle different API versions gracefully
4. WHEN multiple GitLab instances are configured THEN the system SHALL clearly distinguish between them in the UI
5. WHEN a GitLab instance is unreachable THEN the system SHALL display appropriate connectivity status
