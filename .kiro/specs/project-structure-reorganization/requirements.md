# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the reorganization of the GitLab DashWatch project repository to follow modern React/TypeScript best practices. The goal is to improve code maintainability, developer experience, and project scalability while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working on the GitLab DashWatch project, I want a well-organized project structure that follows industry best practices, so that I can easily navigate, understand, and maintain the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the project structure THEN the codebase SHALL follow established React/TypeScript conventions
2. WHEN looking for specific functionality THEN related files SHALL be logically grouped together
3. WHEN adding new features THEN the structure SHALL provide clear guidance on where to place new code
4. WHEN onboarding new developers THEN the project structure SHALL be intuitive and self-documenting

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent file and folder naming conventions throughout the project, so that I can quickly locate and identify different types of files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing component files THEN they SHALL use PascalCase naming (e.g., StatusCard.tsx)
2. WHEN viewing hook files THEN they SHALL use camelCase with 'use' prefix (e.g., useSettings.ts)
3. WHEN viewing service files THEN they SHALL use camelCase naming (e.g., settingsService.ts)
4. WHEN viewing constant files THEN they SHALL use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for exports
5. WHEN viewing type files THEN they SHALL use PascalCase for type definitions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clear separation of concerns in the project structure, so that I can understand the application architecture and make changes confidently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining components THEN they SHALL be organized by feature and reusability
2. WHEN looking at business logic THEN it SHALL be separated from UI components in services
3. WHEN reviewing types THEN they SHALL be centralized and well-organized
4. WHEN checking configuration THEN it SHALL be isolated from application logic
5. WHEN viewing tests THEN they SHALL be co-located with their corresponding source files

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation that reflects the actual project structure, so that I can understand how to work with the codebase effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading the README THEN it SHALL accurately reflect the current project structure
2. WHEN examining the project structure documentation THEN it SHALL provide clear guidance on conventions
3. WHEN looking for examples THEN the documentation SHALL include practical code examples
4. WHEN understanding the architecture THEN the documentation SHALL explain the reasoning behind structural decisions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project to follow modern React ecosystem best practices, so that the codebase remains maintainable and follows industry standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the folder structure THEN it SHALL follow feature-based organization where appropriate
2. WHEN looking at imports THEN they SHALL use consistent absolute path aliases
3. WHEN reviewing component organization THEN it SHALL separate UI components from business logic components
4. WHEN checking file exports THEN they SHALL use consistent export patterns (default vs named)
5. WHEN examining the build configuration THEN it SHALL support the organized structure

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear guidelines for where to place different types of code, so that the project structure remains consistent as it grows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new UI components THEN there SHALL be clear guidance on placement in components/ui vs components/feature
2. WHEN creating new business logic THEN there SHALL be designated locations in services or hooks
3. WHEN defining new types THEN there SHALL be a centralized type organization system
4. WHEN adding configuration THEN there SHALL be appropriate locations for different config types
5. WHEN writing tests THEN there SHALL be consistent patterns for test file placement and naming
