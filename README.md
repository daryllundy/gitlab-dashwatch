A self-hosted monitoring dashboard for GitLab instances, servers, DNS domains, and website uptime. Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. No authentication required - settings are stored locally in your browser.

## Project History

This project was originally created using [Lovable.dev](https://lovable.dev) - an AI-powered development platform that accelerates web application development. The initial prototype was built through Lovable's intuitive prompting interface, which generated a fully functional React application with modern best practices.

The project has since been **completely refactored and enhanced** to run anywhere:
- ✅ Migrated from Lovable.dev's hosted environment to self-hosted deployment
- ✅ Added Docker containerization for universal deployment
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive TypeScript typing and error handling
- ✅ Organized codebase according to industry best practices
- ✅ Added extensive testing suite and CI/CD capabilities
- ✅ Enhanced with production-ready features and documentation

While Lovable.dev provided an excellent foundation for rapid prototyping, this version represents a production-ready application suitable for enterprise deployment.

## Prerequisites

# Type checking and linting
npm run check

# Validate environment configuration
npm run validate:env
```

### Environment Configuration Validation

The project includes automated validation to ensure the `.env.example` file stays in sync with code requirements:

```sh
# Validate .env.example completeness and documentation
npm run validate:env

# Run validation as part of the full check suite
npm run check
```

The validation checks:
- ✅ All required environment variables are documented
- ✅ Account configuration examples are provided
- ✅ Security best practices are documented
- ✅ Use case examples are included
- ✅ Variable naming consistency is maintained

## Settings Storage

GitLab DashWatch stores all settings locally in your browser's localStorage. This means:

- ✅ **No account required**: Start monitoring immediately
- ✅ **Privacy focused**: Your settings never leave your browser
- ✅ **Fast access**: No network calls for settings
- ⚠️ **Browser specific**: Settings are tied to your browser and device
- ⚠️ **Backup recommended**: Export settings if you want to transfer them

**Note**: Settings will be lost if you clear your browser data. Consider exporting your configuration for backup.

## Docker Configuration

### Simple Docker Deployment

No environment variables are required for deployment:

```sh
# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up --build
```

### Development vs Production

- **Development**: Uses `Dockerfile.dev` with hot reload and volume mounting
- **Production**: Uses multi-stage build with optimized Nginx serving

## Quick Start with Docker

The fastest way to get started:

```sh
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/daryllundy/gitlab-dashwatch.git
cd gitlab-dashwatch

# 2. Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up --build

# 3. Visit http://localhost:3000

# 4. Start configuring your monitoring targets in Settings
```

## Architecture & Code Organization

### Component Organization Strategy

**Common Components** (`src/components/common/`)
- Reusable components used across multiple features
- Examples: `ErrorBoundary`, `LoadingSpinner`, `PageLayout`
- Should have minimal dependencies and be highly reusable

**UI Components** (`src/components/ui/`)
- shadcn/ui components and base UI primitives
- Maintained as provided by shadcn/ui
- Should not contain business logic

**Feature Components** (`src/components/features/`)
- Components specific to particular features
- Organized by feature domain (dashboard, gitlab, uptime, dns, server)
- Can import from common and ui components

**Layout Components** (`src/components/layout/`)
- Components that define application layout
- Examples: `Navbar`, `Sidebar`, `Footer`
- Used across multiple pages

### State Management Patterns

- **Global State**: React Context (`SettingsContext`)
- **Server State**: TanStack Query for API calls
- **Local State**: `useState` for component-specific data
- **Settings Storage**: Browser localStorage with service layer abstraction

### Error Handling Strategy

- Global `ErrorBoundary` wraps the entire application
- Feature-specific error boundaries for major sections
- Component-level error states for graceful degradation
- Consistent error logging and user feedback through `src/lib/error.ts`

### Testing Structure

- Tests co-located with components in `__tests__` folders
- Test utilities centralized in `src/test/`
- MSW handlers for API mocking
- Comprehensive coverage for critical paths

#### File Naming Conventions

- **Components**: PascalCase (`StatusCard.tsx`, `GitlabProjectList.tsx`)
- **Hooks**: camelCase with `use` prefix (`useSettings.ts`, `useMobile.tsx`)
- **Services**: camelCase (`settingsService.ts`, `gitlabApiService.ts`)
- **Types**: PascalCase (`GitlabProject`, `StatusType`, `MonitoringConfig`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`DEFAULT_SETTINGS`, `API_ENDPOINTS`)
- **Pages**: PascalCase (`Index.tsx`, `Settings.tsx`)

#### Import Patterns

Use absolute imports with `@/` alias for clean, maintainable code:

```typescript
// React and third-party libraries
import React from 'react';
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';

// Internal components (common → ui → features → layout)
import { LoadingSpinner } from '@/components/common';
import { GitlabProjectCard } from '@/components/features/gitlab';
import { Navbar } from '@/components/layout';

// Hooks and contexts
import { useSettings } from '@/contexts/SettingsContext';

// Services and utilities
import { gitlabApiService } from '@/services';
import { formatDate } from '@/lib/date';

// Types and constants
import type { GitlabProject } from '@/types';
import { ROUTES } from '@/constants';
```

#### Developer Guidelines

**Adding New Components:**
- **Reusable components** → `src/components/common/`
- **UI primitives** → `src/components/ui/` (shadcn/ui components)
- **Feature-specific** → `src/components/features/[feature]/`
- **Layout components** → `src/components/layout/`

**Adding New Business Logic:**
- **API services** → `src/services/[domain]/`
- **Custom hooks** → `src/hooks/`
- **Utility functions** → `src/lib/`

**Adding New Types:**
- **Centralized types** → `src/types/index.ts`
- **Group by feature domain** (GitLab, monitoring, etc.)

**Adding Configuration:**
- **Environment handling** → `src/config/env.ts`
- **App constants** → `src/constants/index.ts`
- **Default configs** → `src/config/defaults.ts`

**Writing Tests:**
- **Co-locate with components** → `ComponentName/__tests__/ComponentName.test.tsx`
- **Test utilities** → `src/test/`
- **Integration tests** → `src/test/integration/`
